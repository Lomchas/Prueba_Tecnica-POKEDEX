# Getting started with the PokeDex app âš™
---

- As a primary element we must have `Node.js` globally to run all the commands below...
- Install dependencies: `npm i` or `npm install`
- Run project: `npm start` or `npm run start`

This project started with [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

With the command `npx create-react-app [App name - no_spaces_no_caps]`

## scripts available

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` -- 'You are going to start running the app on the server'
### `npm test` -- 'Runnable menu to run app tests while in development'
### `npm run build` -- 'When the project is ready it will run to create a production folder'
### `npm run eject`

Run the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see lint errors in the console.

## Work Tools ðŸ”—

The following tools and dependencies were implemented for the realization of the project,
Below we briefly describe how it was implemented and its use in the application:

- `React` (As a javaScript library).
- `Redux` (As application state handler) *This was implemented to host the API information (Pokemon) and user handling*.
- `Firebase` - Google (As User Authenticator) *All user treatment is managed with this tool*.
- `bootstrap` (As Style Editor of our interface) *With this framework we work only with the bootstrap `Progress-bar` element*
- `React-Icons` (As a provider of `SVG` icons) *This tool was used in the handling of illustrative `SVG` files of our app*
- `Jest`, `Enzyme`, `Enzyme-to-Json`, `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` (Providers of tools for the testing part of our app)
 
 ## Clone Repository ðŸ—‚
 
 - `cd` 'Our folder to host the project'/
 - `git init`
 - `git clone https://github.com/Lomchas/Prueba_Tecnica-POKEDEX.git`
 
 ***Ready!! you already have your repository created, you just have to insert the node modules on your computer,
 from the terminal of your project with the command `npm install` or `npm i`***
